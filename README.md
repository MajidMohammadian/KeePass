KeePass, an efficient password manager, securely organizes your credentials. This free, open-source tool offers a seamless experience across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Lightweight and installation-free, it's portable on a USB drive. Employing robust encryption, KeePass generates and stores strong passwords, facilitates secure sharing, and enables backups. It simplifies import/export tasks and ensures synchronization across devices. Protecting access with master passwords and advanced authentication options like two-factor, biometric, PIN, security key, and recovery code, KeePass ensures comprehensive security. Additionally, it offers customizable security measures such as questions, answers, phrases, images, fingerprints, patterns, gestures, voice, and facial recognition.

## Installation

This is a good version for both Linux and Windows that you can download from this [link](https://github.com/MajidMohammadian/KeePass/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Usage Windows

run the `KeePass.exe` file and enjoy it.

## Usage Linux

In Linux, because you cannot run files with the .exe extension, you must use the following commands:


```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mono mono-complete -y
```

```bash
mono /path/to/directory/KeePass.exe
```

### Add to menu ubuntu

To add the application to the menu, you must create a `.desktop` file in the `/usr/share/applications` directory.

```bash
sudo touch /usr/share/applications/KeePass.desktop
```
    
Then open the file with the nano editor and paste the following code into it.
    
```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/KeePass.desktop
```

```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Name=KeePass
Comment=KeePass is a password manager
Exec=mono /path/to/directory/KeePass.exe
Icon=/path/to/directory/KeePass.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
```

Then save the file and run the following command to update the menu.

```bash
sudo update-desktop-database
```

Now you can search for the application in the menu and run it.
